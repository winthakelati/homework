		</header>
		<p>A Bay Area native, I was born in San Francisco, but grew up in the East Bay in Fremont, California. With the exception of my college years, during which I lived in Cambridge, MA, I have always been a California girl. </p>
		<p>During college I was a history major, with the intention of going to law school after grduation.After graduating from college, I decided to pursue a career in teaching with Teach for America. I was placed as a preschool teacher, teaching at a Head Start program in San Francisco. Unfortunately, at the end of my two year commitment with Teach for America, my school shut down and I was forced to look for a new job.</p>
		<p>I currently work in the tech industry at a company called Optimizely, mainly focusing on marketing automation. I've worked on a number of projects, including revamping our onboarding, scaling customer success communcations, nurturing new leads, and more. In my spare time, I spend a great deal of time with family, volunteering with various organization such as BUILD, and traveling around the US and world. I'm really looking forward to growing and learning throughout this class. </p>
