Add all materials for your final project proposal and wireframes in this folder.

You can add images, pdfs, text documents, whatever format you choose.

When all your materials are added, you'll go ahead and "Add", "commit", and "push" in the Github desktop app just like you do with your other homework.

Be sure to write "FINAL" in your last commit message.
